# AI Predictive Methods for Credit Underwriting

This project is a **Streamlit-based AI Predictive Methods for Credit Underwriting** application that utilizes a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be **approved or rejected** based on user-provided inputs. The app also generates a **downloadable PDF report** with detailed results and insights.

## Features

- **Interactive Web App**: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and responsive user interface.
- **User Inputs**: Fields for CIBIL score, income, loan amount, loan term, and more.
- **Prediction Model**: Uses a pre-trained machine learning model to determine loan approval status.
- **Downloadable Report**: Generates a professional **PDF report** summarizing predictions and user inputs.
- **EMI Calculator**: Calculate monthly EMI based on loan amount, interest rate, and term.
- **AI Chatbot**: Provides financial advice and helps users with loan-related queries.
- **Enhanced Styling**: Custom CSS for a better user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for building the application.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for creating the interactive web app.
- **FPDF**: Library for generating downloadable PDF reports.
- **pandas**: For data preparation and handling user inputs.
- **matplotlib**: For optional visualizations.
- **joblib**: For loading the pre-trained machine learning model.
- **transformers**: For NLP-based chatbot responses (using pre-trained models).
- **langdetect**: For language detection (used in the chatbot).

  - Input details provided by the user.
  - Summary of probabilities.

## Deployment

The application is live and can be accessed at:
[AI Predictive Methods for Credit Underwriting](https://ai-predictive-methods-for-credit-underwriting-csu8gym5fctrsyru.streamlit.app/)

To deploy the app on **Streamlit Cloud**:

To deploy the app on **Streamlit Cloud**:

1. **Push the project to GitHub.**
2. **Connect your GitHub repository to Streamlit Cloud.**
3. **Ensure `requirements.txt` is present for dependency installation.**
4. **Deploy and access your app via the Streamlit Cloud link.**

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Library Error
If you encounter an error like `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fpdf'`, install it manually:
```bash
pip install fpdf
```

### Unicode Character Error (₹ Symbol)
Ensure you have a Unicode-compatible font (e.g., `FreeSerif.ttf`) in your working directory. Update the PDF font registration in the code if necessary.
