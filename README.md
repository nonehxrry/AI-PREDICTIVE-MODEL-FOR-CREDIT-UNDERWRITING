AI Predictive Methods for Credit Underwriting
This project is a Streamlit-based AI Predictive Methods for Credit Underwriting application that utilizes a machine learning model to predict whether a loan application will be approved or rejected based on user-provided inputs. The app generates a downloadable PDF report with detailed results and insights.

Features
Interactive Web App: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and responsive user interface.
User Inputs: Input fields for CIBIL score, income, loan amount, loan term, and other details.
Prediction: Uses a pre-trained machine learning model to predict loan approval status.
Downloadable Report: Generates a professional PDF report summarizing predictions and input details.
Styling: Custom CSS for enhanced user experience.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for building the application.
Streamlit: Framework for creating the interactive web app.
FPDF: Library for generating downloadable PDF reports.
pandas: For data preparation and handling user inputs.
matplotlib: For visualizations (optional).
joblib: For loading the pre-trained machine learning model.
